# Anonymizing Submissions `(anonSubs.py)`
- Python script that takes a zipped or unzipped folder and renames the files within it to a random ID.  Made to anonymize student submissions.

- When inputting a folder, the folder name should either be in the current directory OR a path to the folder from the root directory.

- to run the file input should be: `user$: python3 anonScript.py <folder or folder path>`


**Subs.zip and 10000Folders.zip are sample files**
